webscraping for greater good

## #1: Permaseminka

For now, there is only one web, permaseminka.cz, which made me crazy a little bit (sorry, Marku Kvapile). 
Checking all my favourite items one by one many times in a year got too boring.

In fact, the ultimate goal is to create a regular digest and alert me if some of my list of items gets from 'sold' state to 'available' again.

But for now, I've created just a short script to get all the items visible on Marek's web, with label sold and new, with their weblinks, to one all-mighty csv in the end.


### TODO: 
- There is nothing settable right now (e.g. no wishlist, not sure if there is anything else to add)
- Marek added new 'sold' labels stating when the seeds will be avaliable again - can change the game a little bit... 
- second webpage should be permaland.cz 
- then maybe some CZ mortgage refinancing interest rates >:-) 

Enjoy!
